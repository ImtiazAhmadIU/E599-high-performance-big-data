#### Summary
Racing sports is attracting billions of audiences each year. Although not directly affiliated to a specific science field, it is powered and transformed by latest data analysis technologies, from race car design to social media analysis. However, most of them are off-line and retrospective analysis and real-time data analysis is not common in this field. The task of this term project is to use the data to detect some interesting event which can be treat as anomaly. In this paper, we will use four different online anomaly detection algorithms to analyze the data of IndyCar 500 and compare the difference in principle and accuracy of the four algorithms.
